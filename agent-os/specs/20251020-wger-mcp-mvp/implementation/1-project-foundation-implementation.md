# Task 1: Project Foundation & Tooling

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task Group 1 from `agent-os/specs/20251020-wger-mcp-mvp/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** foundation-engineer (API Engineer role)
**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Establish the entire project structure, configuration files, and development tooling for the TypeScript MCP server. This includes initializing the npm package, configuring TypeScript with strict mode, setting up linting and formatting tools, configuring Jest for testing, implementing environment variable handling, and creating a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.

## Implementation Summary
Successfully initialized a greenfield TypeScript project for the wger MCP server with a complete development environment. The implementation followed industry best practices for Node.js/TypeScript projects, including strict type checking, automated code quality tools, comprehensive testing infrastructure, and CI/CD automation. All configuration files were created with production-ready settings aligned with the project's 80% test coverage target and Node.js 18+ LTS requirement.

The project structure was organized into clear, logical directories separating source code, tests, and documentation. Environment variable handling was implemented with runtime validation using Zod schemas to ensure type-safe configuration. The GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline was configured to run on multiple Node.js versions (18.x and 20.x) with a complete workflow covering linting, type-checking, testing, and coverage reporting.

## Key Implementation Details

### Component 1: NPM Package Configuration
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/wger-mcp/package.json`

Created a comprehensive package.json with all required dependencies and development tooling. Key dependencies include:
- **Runtime dependencies:** @modelcontextprotocol/sdk (^1.0.0), axios (^1.6.0), zod (^3.22.0), dotenv (^16.3.0)
- **Development dependencies:** TypeScript (^5.2.0), Jest (^29.7.0), ESLint (^8.50.0), Prettier (^3.0.0), MSW (^2.0.0), ts-jest (^29.1.0)

Configured npm scripts for:
- `build`: TypeScript compilation
- `test`: Run Jest tests
- `test:coverage`: Generate coverage reports
- `lint`: Run ESLint
- `format`: Auto-format code with Prettier
- `format:check`: Check code formatting
- `type-check`: TypeScript type checking without emitting files
- `prepare`: Pre-publish build hook

**Rationale:** Following standard Node.js package conventions ensures compatibility with npm ecosystem and CI/CD tools. The prepare script ensures the package is always built before publishing.

### Component 2: TypeScript Configuration
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/wger-mcp/tsconfig.json`

Configured TypeScript with strict mode and additional safety checks:
- `strict: true` - Enables all strict type checking options
- `noUnusedLocals: true` - Prevents unused local variables
- `noUnusedParameters: true` - Prevents unused function parameters
- `noImplicitReturns: true` - Ensures all code paths return a value
- `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch: true` - Prevents fall-through in switch statements
- Target: ES2022, Module: CommonJS for Node.js compatibility
- Output: `dist/` directory with source maps and declaration files

**Rationale:** Strict TypeScript configuration catches errors at compile time and improves code quality. Declaration files enable type checking for consumers of the package. ES2022 target provides modern JavaScript features while maintaining Node.js 18+ compatibility.

### Component 3: Code Quality Tools
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/wger-mcp/.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc`

ESLint configuration includes:
- TypeScript-specific rules with type-aware linting
- Prettier integration to avoid conflicts
- No console.log in production (warning level)
- Strict rules for floating promises and unused variables
- Error on `any` types to maintain type safety

Prettier configuration:
- 100 character print width for readability
- Single quotes, trailing commas (ES5), semicolons
- 2-space indentation with LF line endings

**Rationale:** Automated code quality tools ensure consistent style and catch common errors. The configuration balances strictness with developer productivity.

### Component 4: Testing Infrastructure
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/wger-mcp/jest.config.js`

Jest configured with:
- ts-jest preset for TypeScript support
- 80% minimum coverage threshold (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- Test files in `tests/` directory with patterns for `.test.ts` and `.spec.ts`
- Coverage collection from `src/**/*.ts` excluding test files
- Module path aliases for cleaner imports
- 10-second test timeout for integration tests

**Rationale:** Jest is the industry standard for JavaScript testing. The 80% coverage threshold aligns with project requirements while remaining achievable. Path aliases improve code readability.

### Component 5: Environment Configuration
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/wger-mcp/src/config.ts`

Implemented type-safe configuration management:
- Zod schema validation for all environment variables
- Support for both API key and username/password authentication
- Default values for optional settings
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Runtime validation ensures configuration integrity at startup

Configuration options:
- Authentication: WGER_API_KEY or WGER_USERNAME + WGER_PASSWORD
- API URL: WGER_API_URL (default: https://wger.de/api/v2)
- Timeouts: HTTP_TIMEOUT (default: 10000ms)
- Logging: LOG_LEVEL (default: info)
- Cache TTLs: CACHE_TTL_STATIC (24h), CACHE_TTL_EXERCISE (1h)

**Rationale:** Zod provides runtime type safety that complements TypeScript's compile-time checking. Validating configuration at startup prevents runtime errors from misconfiguration. Clear defaults make the package easy to use.

### Component 6: CI/CD Pipeline
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/wger-mcp/.github/workflows/test.yml`

GitHub Actions workflow with:
- Matrix strategy testing Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- Sequential steps: lint → format check → type check → test with coverage
- Codecov integration for coverage reporting
- Runs on pushes to main/master and all pull requests
- Uses npm ci for reproducible installs

**Rationale:** Testing on multiple Node.js versions ensures compatibility. The sequential workflow catches errors early (lint/format issues before running slow tests). Codecov provides visibility into coverage trends over time.

### Component 7: Project Structure
**Location:** Multiple directories under `/home/ericreyes/github/wger-mcp/`

Created directory structure:
```
src/
  ├── client/      # HTTP client, auth, cache
  ├── schemas/     # Zod validation schemas
  ├── tools/       # MCP tool implementations
  ├── types/       # TypeScript type definitions
  └── utils/       # Shared utilities (logging, errors)
tests/
  ├── unit/        # Unit tests by module
  ├── integration/ # End-to-end integration tests
  ├── fixtures/    # Test data and mock responses
  └── setup/       # Test configuration (MSW setup)
docs/              # User-facing documentation
```

**Rationale:** Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easy to navigate. Mirroring the src/ structure in tests/ makes it easy to find related tests. The fixtures/ directory centralizes test data for reuse.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Coding Style Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- **Consistent Naming:** Used descriptive names throughout (e.g., `ConfigSchema`, `loadConfig`, `cacheTtlStatic`)
- **Automated Formatting:** Configured Prettier with automatic formatting on save
- **Meaningful Names:** Avoided abbreviations (e.g., `httpTimeout` not `httpTO`)
- **DRY Principle:** Created reusable config module rather than duplicating environment variable parsing
- **Remove Dead Code:** No commented-out code or unused imports in any configuration files

**Deviations:** None

### Conventions Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- **Consistent Project Structure:** Organized files into logical directories (src/, tests/, docs/)
- **Clear Documentation:** Created .env.example with detailed comments for each variable
- **Version Control:** Initialized git repository with comprehensive .gitignore
- **Environment Configuration:** Used environment variables for all configuration, never commit secrets
- **Dependency Management:** Locked all dependency versions with package-lock.json
- **Testing Requirements:** Configured 80% coverage threshold in Jest

**Deviations:** None

### Tech Stack Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
This is a greenfield project, so the tech stack was defined by the specification:
- **Runtime:** Node.js 18+ with TypeScript 5.2+
- **Package Manager:** npm with package-lock.json
- **Testing:** Jest with ts-jest transformer
- **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint + Prettier
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

All choices align with modern TypeScript/Node.js best practices.

**Deviations:** None - this task established the tech stack per specification requirements

### Error Handling Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
The config.ts module implements proper error handling:
- Catches Zod validation errors and transforms them into user-friendly messages
- Validates authentication configuration and throws clear errors if missing
- Provides specific error messages indicating which configuration is invalid

**Deviations:** None

### Validation Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/validation.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Used Zod schemas for runtime validation of environment variables
- Validates data types (strings, numbers, enums) at application startup
- Enforces required fields and provides defaults for optional fields
- Clear validation error messages that explain what's wrong

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints
Not applicable - this task focused on project foundation. API endpoints will be implemented in later task groups.

### External Services
- **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD workflow runs on GitHub's infrastructure
- **Codecov (optional):** Coverage reporting integration configured but not required

### Internal Dependencies
The configuration module (src/config.ts) will be imported by all other modules that need access to environment settings. This establishes a centralized configuration pattern for the entire application.

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
No known issues. All verification steps passed successfully.

### Limitations
1. **Coverage Enforcement:** Jest coverage thresholds are configured but cannot be validated until tests are written
   - **Impact:** Low - threshold enforcement will activate automatically once tests exist
   - **Future Consideration:** Task Groups 6-7 will validate coverage meets 80% target

2. **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions workflow created but not tested in actual CI environment
   - **Impact:** Low - workflow syntax is valid and follows GitHub Actions best practices
   - **Future Consideration:** Will be validated when code is pushed to GitHub repository

## Performance Considerations
Not applicable for infrastructure setup. Performance targets will be addressed during implementation of core functionality (Task Group 2+).

## Security Considerations
- **.env files:** Added to .gitignore to prevent accidental commit of secrets
- **Environment validation:** Config module validates authentication credentials at startup
- **Dependency security:** Used latest stable versions of all dependencies with no known vulnerabilities (npm audit showed 0 vulnerabilities)

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
All subsequent task groups (2-8) depend on this foundation setup. Specifically:
- **Task Group 2** (Core Infrastructure) requires TypeScript, ESLint, and build tooling
- **Task Group 6** (Unit Tests) requires Jest configuration
- **Task Group 7** (Integration Tests) requires MSW and test infrastructure
- **Task Group 8** (Documentation) will reference CI/CD badges and npm scripts

## Notes

### Successful Verification Steps
1. Initialized git repository successfully
2. Created all required directories (src/, tests/, docs/, with subdirectories)
3. Installed 493 npm packages with 0 vulnerabilities
4. TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
5. ESLint runs successfully on existing source files
6. Prettier validates code formatting compliance
7. Jest configuration validated (runs with --passWithNoTests flag)
8. Package-lock.json generated successfully (233KB)
9. Build process generates dist/ output with declaration files and source maps

### Key Decisions
1. **Node.js Version:** Targeted 18+ LTS for modern features while maintaining broad compatibility
2. **Module System:** Used CommonJS for better Node.js compatibility (vs ESM which has some tooling issues)
3. **Test Framework:** Chose Jest over alternatives (Vitest, Mocha) due to ecosystem maturity and MSW integration
4. **Linting Strategy:** Combined ESLint + Prettier for comprehensive code quality enforcement
5. **Config Validation:** Used Zod for runtime validation to complement TypeScript's compile-time checking
